Hi 👋, I'm **Sanjay Upadhyay**, a Cloud and AI Engineer focused on **OpenStack**, **Kubernetes**, and **automation at scale**.  
I enjoy designing and documenting real-world infrastructure setups that blend **open-source cloud platforms** with **AI and data workloads**.

### What This Site Covers
- Infrastructure automation with **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **Helm**
- On-prem and hybrid cloud orchestration using **OpenStack** and **Kubernetes**
- **AI model deployment and inference pipelines** on edge and cloud
- Experimentation with **networking**, **storage**, and **virtualization**

### Current Focus
- Multi-tenant Kubernetes-as-a-Service architectures  
- CPU-optimized LLM inference  
- Observability and model lifecycle management in hybrid clouds
