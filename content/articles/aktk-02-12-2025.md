### Curated list of todays hidden news.

# 1) “Empty Streets, Shrinking Cities: China’s Economic Reality” — *Digging into China* (YouTube)

**Summary:** A recent Digging into China video examines China’s faltering property sector, municipal debt and ghost-city indicators, tying empty malls and reduced mobility to policy choices (housing tax experiments, local government land-sale shortfalls) rather than simple cyclical slowdown. The presenter uses on-the-ground footage and aggregated local data to argue China’s internal demand weakness is broader and more structural than many mainstream pieces acknowledge. ([YouTube][1])

**Subtle/under-noticed point:** The channel highlights how **local treasury shortfalls are now feeding into reduced municipal services and infrastructure slowdowns**, which in turn depress household confidence — a self-reinforcing cycle that mainstream headlines focus on as “economic data misses” but rarely tie to municipal financing mechanics. This has implications for China’s near-term fiscal responses and commodity demand. ([YouTube][2])

# 2) “Bizarre negotiations and intel back channels” — *The Duran* / Alex Christoforou (YouTube / podcast)

**Summary:** The Duran’s latest episode digs into recent diplomatic back-channels around the Ukraine conflict and related US/EU signaling. The hosts synthesize leaked reporting, regional interviews, and diplomatic timelines to suggest negotiation dynamics in play are more fluid (and less Washington-centric) than routine coverage portrays. They also trace how non-state influencers and private envoys are shaping options on the table. ([YouTube][3])

**Subtle/under-noticed point:** The episode flags that **small diplomatic teams and private intermediaries — not just formal capitals — are increasingly determining whether ceasefire concepts survive early vetting**. That changes how to read “failed talks” headlines: some setbacks are tactical repositioning rather than outright collapse. This nuance is often missing from mainstream summaries. ([YouTube][3])

# 3) Recent Geopolitics & Empire podcast posts — *Geopolitics & Empire* (podcast & site)

**Summary:** Geopolitics & Empire posts and podcast episodes regularly host long-form interviews with regional experts (Middle East, Eurasia, tech/AI geopolitics). Recent episodes emphasize how ideological framing and technological controls are reshaping alliances (e.g., how surveillance tech and export controls enter diplomatic bargaining). The site publishes essays that tie cultural/ideological moves to concrete policy choices. ([Geopolitics & Empire -][4])

**Subtle/under-noticed point:** G&E repeatedly surfaces the role of **non-traditional levers — tech governance, sanctions design, and private sector behavior — as decisive diplomatic tools**. While mainstream outlets cover sanctions or tech disputes, G&E emphasizes long-tail institutional mechanisms (licensing, data-localization rules) that quietly reshape geopolitical alignment. That’s a useful lens for longer-term strategy analysis. ([Geopolitics & Empire -][4])

If you’d like, I can:

* Expand this into a downloadable markdown file (I can generate it right away).
* Fetch transcripts or timestamps for the exact minutes where the “under-noticed” points are discussed.
* Add 2–3 more independent creators (Substack or YouTube) in the same vein.
